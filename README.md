# KitchenChaosEcs

This game based on free course from Codemonkey https://unitycodemonkey.com/kitchenchaoscourse.php
but using ECS pattern.

This is not 100% pure DOTS solution, but all the logic and most of rendering are made using ECS. I left UI, sounds and animations for MonoBehaviours and bound them with entities using Managed components.

Version of entities package used is 1.0.0-pre.65
